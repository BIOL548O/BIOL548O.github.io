## Open Science

>Fully open science can take place throughout the process of discovery, from the sharing of nascent ideas, to the uploading of data at the moment of capture, through to developing “living papers” in an open forum in which the details of analysis and reasoning are completely transparent. Subsequent generations of ecologists will build their work on what we leave.

## Bias in research data

>Researchers in psychology, a field rocked by findings of irreproducibility in the past few years, have been especially vocal proponents of the drive for more-open science. In one of the latest examples of irreproducibility issues, investigators tried to replicate results from 100 psychological studies but succeeded in fewer than half of them

## Misc

[daff](http://paulfitz.github.io/daff/), also exists as [an R package](https://github.com/edwindj/daff)

Awesome use for your skills : [zika data cleaning](https://github.com/cdcepi/zika)

## Awesome & related R packages

The *Hadleyverse*

* tidy model outputs with [`broom`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom)
* manipulate times and dates with [`lubridate`](https://github.com/hadley/lubridate)
* control your character vectors with [`stringr`](https://github.com/hadley/stringr) 
* pretty plots with ggplot2
