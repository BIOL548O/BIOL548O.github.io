## Outline for today

* Some very quick [slides about metadata]()
* Group discussion activity
* an [Introduction to writing metadata](writing_metadata)
* Description of [Homework 3: the Final Project](Homework_3)


#### Let's begin with an exercise!
1. Break into evenly distributed groups of 3 people. *(2 mins)*  
2. Identify one volunteer to be the “Researcher” and describe their research data for this exercise.  This person will need to be fairly familiar with how and why the data was collected. *(2 mins)*  
3. Identify a note taker to record responses to questions from the group about the data set. *(1 min)*  
4. members of the group ask questions of the “Researcher” about her or his data set while the note taker records responses.  (The note taker can ask questions, too!)  As you ask questions, think about how you would (if you could) respond to a similar question for your data set. *(15 mins)*
