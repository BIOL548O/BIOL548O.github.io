## Homework 2

***clean your data***

The goal that I want to achieve for *everyone* with this assignment is how to process data with code accurately. However, where you end up will depend a lot on where you begin.  

Come tomorrow with the most _raw_ version of your data you can find. This might be the spreadsheet you typed in when you recorded your data, or which was emailed to you. It may be a series of text files that you received from your instrument. It might even be a link to a shared folder on Dropbox, or some other online source of information.
